Terms of a lifetime subscription refund policy also apply to 12 (twelve)- and 6 (six)-month subscription refund policies.</p>

            <p>NOTE THAT: if you have made a request for a refund during but not exceeding the first 14 (fourteen) full days of the month of request we grant you with a partial refund that covers the price of the subscription including the month of request. If you have made a request for a refund after the first 14 (fourteen) full days of the month of request we grant you with a partial refund that covers the price of the subscription NOT including the month of request.</p>

            <p>A request for a refund is valid only during the period of purchased 6 (six) - month or 12 (twelve) - month subscription plan. For a 24 (twenty-four) - month subscription plan a request for a refund is valid during the first twelve months of the purchase and for a lifetime subscription plan a request for a refund is valid during the first 14 (fourteen) days of the purchase.</p>

            <p>E.2. ‘Month of request’ is a month when the actual request for a refund is conducted.</p>

            <p>F. The calculation of the amount of money needed for a refund is executed by our customer support department by using a certain algorithm that could be clarified with our Customer Support Agents.</p>

            <p>Before requesting a refund, the customer must inform our customer support department of any issues that may arise in relation to our software. Refunds are given ONLY in case of contacting our support team and sending a request in written form via email. The email address where the request is subject to be sent will be provided to you by one of our Customer Support Agents. Our customer support department is obliged to do their best to fix the problem. If they confirm that the software problem cannot be fixed, a refund will be given. The company is not responsible for any independent actions taken by the customer or help from any third parties.</p>

            <p>After submitting a request for a refund to а Customer Support Agent it will be reviewed and processed, unless a refund can not be performed due to the terms and conditions set forth herein. In this case you will be notified via email or phone as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>The company provides the customers with support, via email support, phone support, etc. Therefore if the customer did not follow the instructions, set up wrong preferences or refused to use our customer support service, the company has the right to decline the refund request.</p>

            <p>If the software is purchased via the Internet, it does not include any physical storage media. Refunds are not given in case of ignorance of this fact.</p>

            <p>Inability to download the software is not an argument for the refund. The customer can have Internet or computer problems not related to our product.</p>

            <p>Once the refund is given, further usage of the software becomes illegal; therefore the customer must uninstall the program. In addition, all registration data will be immediately blocked, and the refunded customer will not be able to use the updates.</p>

            <p>Refunds are processed within 1 to 3 weeks - this time is needed by the bank to process the payment.</p>

            <p>In case of double charge due to circumstances beyond the customer’s control, if the fact thereof is confirmed, the company is obliged to give the refund upon the customer’s request.</p>

            <p>All processing fees are non-refundable.</p>

            <p>The customer has no right to request a refund for additional customer support service orders that: (i) had been fully used but the quality was claimed as unsatisfactory, (ii) were partly used,</p>

            <p>(iii) were not used at all.</p>
